            <p>Lithuania, officially the Republic of Lithuania, is a country in the Baltic region of Europe. Since its independence, Lithuania is considered to be one of the Baltic states. It is situated along the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea, to the east of Sweden and Denmark. It is bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and Kaliningrad Oblast to the southwest.</p>

        <div id="why" class = "why">
            <h3 class = "title" >Why is Lithuania special?</h3>
            <p>Lithuania has an estimated population of 2.7 million people as of 2019, and its capital and largest city is Vilnius. Other major cities are Kaunas and Klaipėda. Lithuanians are Baltic people. The official language, Lithuanian, along with Latvian, is one of only two living languages in the Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family.</p>
            <p>Lithuania is special of its amazing nature. Lithuania has all of the four seasons, which give the most beautiful views. Swimming in the lakes and rivers, watching sunsets in the nature or near the sea, doing barbeques and making campfires on warm summer evenings. Having a walk in the forest watching the beautiful sights of fall and coloured trees. The winter is stunning of its white beauty after the snow storms, which you can watch inside your home with a hot cup of tea. You can enjoy snow fights and skiing just outside your home. Even though winter may seem amazing and fun, everyone still waits for spring to come. People miss the warmth and beauty of it. The blooming flowers and trees spreading leaves. After a long time people can slowly start having summer activities again. Another special thing of Lithuania is its history, cities and the places you can visit. One of the most beautiful places in Lithuania would be the Curionian Spit. It is a 98 km long, thin, curved sand-dune spit that separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea coast. It's even in the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Another amazing place is the Trakų pilis, which is on an island in the middle of the lake and in Eastern Europe it is the only island castle, which makes it even more special. Another place is the Gediminas' Tower, wchich is the symbol of the capital Vilnius. Gediminas' Tower is an important state and historic symbol of the city of Vilnius and of Lithuania itself and it also follows an interesting <a class = "link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gediminas%27_Tower#Legend">legend</a>.</p>
